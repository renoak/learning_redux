# learning_redux
A dummy web app to add some items to cart using react redux


1: Download the code and run npm install to install all the react and redux packages.
2: In this I have used Firebase as a backend database and therefore replace the database link in src\store\cart-actions.js.
3: Add some data to get displayed in the page.
